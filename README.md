Essentially the flow of the class involves slowly building up more and more parts of a new ore that they will make. 

The first thing they do is create an item of that ore, and learn about all the files, paths, and json files needed for just one item
They eventually add this item, along with its textures and properties.

Then, they add a block of their specific type of ore, this is mostly the same as adding an item, but with a few more steps here and there.
Now for the properties of the blocks, they will learn how to make stuff drop from the blocks, and how to make them mineable.
Finally they will add recipes for their newly made blocks and ores.

The following day will be spent making their specific set of tools, from the ore that they chose.
This involves creating new tags, and new item properties that will be new to them

The last day will be spent making an enum from scratch essentially. This will be their first experience messing sort of behind the scenes
This should take up most of the day, and by the end have the armor set of whatever ore they chose.
